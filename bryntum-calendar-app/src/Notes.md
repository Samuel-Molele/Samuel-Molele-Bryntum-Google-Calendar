# Project Overview

This project intergrates Google Sign-in functionality with a Bryntum Calendar, allowing users to authenticate via their Gooogle
account and view their Google Calendar events in a customized calendar interface. The frontend is built with React+Vite,
while the backend is built using Express.js, and Google API IS used for authentication nad data fetching.


## Current Status

- **Frontend**: 
  - Google Sign-In functionality is integrated with React+Vite.
  - Bryntum Calendar is set up to display events.
- **Backend**: 
  - The Express server is running and verifying the Google ID token.
  - The backend does not yet return a JWT for further authentication, but it validates the token and returns user data.
- **Authentication**: 
  - **Google ID Token** is used for authentication.
  - Users are able to sign in with Google, and token verification occurs on the backend.

## Remaining Tasks

### Frontend

1. **Google Authentication Handling**:
   - Securely store the Google token (e.g., `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`).
   - Handle token expiration and refresh logic.
   - Display the user's profile information (e.g., name, email) after a successful sign-in.
   


2. **Fetch Google Calendar Events**:
   - Implement error handling for failed event fetches.
   - Ensure backend validation of the Google ID token before fetching events.
   - Format Google Calendar events to be compatible with Bryntum Calendar.

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add a loading indicator while fetching events from the backend.
   - Display clear error messages when there are issues with sign-in or event fetching.
   - Add signout button and logic to allow users to logout.

### Backend

1. **Event Retrieval**:
   - Implement the `/api/getEvents` route to fetch Google Calendar events.
   - Handle pagination for calendars with many events.

2. **Security**:
   - Use HTTPS to secure token transmission between the frontend and backend.
   - Secure API endpoints that require authentication.
   - Implement a refresh mechanism for Google ID tokens, if necessary.

---

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write tests for both frontend and backend logic, especially around Google Sign-In and event fetching.
   
2. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Implement tests for the entire user flow, from signing in with Google to fetching and displaying calendar events.

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Implement state management for user data, including token storage.
   - Add proper formatting for Google Calendar events to integrate smoothly with Bryntum.
   - Add error handling and loading indicators for better user experience.

### 2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Integrate the Google Calendar API to fetch user events.
   - Implement token verification on the backend before accessing the calendar.
   - Handle pagination and format the events for the frontend.

### 3. **Testing**:
   - Write tests to ensure both frontend and backend functionalities are working as expected.
   - Use a testing framework like **Jest** or **Mocha** for unit testing.
   - Implement **Cypress** or **Puppeteer** for end-to-end testing.

### 4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy both the frontend and backend to their respective platforms.
   - Ensure that the production environment is secure and scalable.

## Conclusion

Once these tasks are completed, the project will offer full Google Sign-In functionality with the ability to view Google Calendar events in a Bryntum Calendar. Security improvements, error handling, and improved UI, ensuring a smooth user experience.
